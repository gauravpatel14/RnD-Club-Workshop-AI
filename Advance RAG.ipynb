The authors\\nexamined the extended transition period from puberty to mature\\nadulthood in the mid-twenties and explored various candidatevariables to explain the rising prevalence. Despite their extensive\\nanalysis, they found it challenging to draw de ﬁnitive conclusions.\\nUltimately, they attributed the trend more to increasing family\\ndiscord and heightened expectations, particularly related to\\nemployment than to other potential factors such as mass media,migration, social disadvantages, unemployment, poor physical\\nhealth, and declining moral values.\\nHowever, the trend of mental health prevenance and burden\\ndepends on many factors, e.g., geographical region, socio-',\n"," 'demographic status of the region, gender and age group as well as\\nhow the prevenance and burden are measured. For example,\\naccording to the 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study ( 2), the\\nprevalence of mental disorders remained relatively stable or\\ndecreasing in most countries except for young people 10-19 years\\nin high and high-middle Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) countries\\nprior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in increases in all\\nage groups across all SDI categories, see Figure 1A . However, the\\npercentage of the total burden attributable to mental disorders, see\\nFigure 1B or mental disorders, self-harm and substance use\\ncombined, see Figure 1C increases gradually among those aged\\nFIGURE 1\\nTrends of the burden of mental disorders by age group, country Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) estimated from Global Burden of Disease Study\\n2021 (2) (A)Prevalence of mental disorders; and (B)Percentage Disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) attributable to mental disorders, (C)Percentage',\n"," 'DALYs attributable to mental disorders, self-harm and substance use disorders.McGorry et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1517533\\nFrontiers in Psychiatry frontiersin.org 02',\n"," '10-34 across most of the SDI categories highlighting the substantial\\ncontribution of mental health disorders and self-harm to overall\\nhealth loss in these populations.\\nWhile depression and anxiety can impact people of all ages ( 3–5),\\nyouth aged 10 –24 are at a higher risk of experiencing these and other\\nmental disorders ( 6–9). The pathway to emerging adulthood, from\\nearly adolescence to young adulthood, is a time of signi ﬁcant\\nbiological, social and personal change that has evolved over\\ngenerations ( 10). This period is marked by major life milestones\\nand transitions that coincide with the peak onset of mental disorders\\n(11). Lost productivity at this life stage due to mental illness poses a\\nsigniﬁcant psychosocial and economic burden ( 12). The imperative\\nto address the mental health needs of young people has been\\nrecognised and signi ﬁcant reforms have commenced in some high-\\nincome countries to improve mental health service provision for this',\n"," 'population ( 13,14). These efforts are modest and insuf ﬁcient in\\nproportion to the scale of need and rapidly rising rates of youth\\nmental ill-health that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19\\npandemic ( 15).Until recently, the evidence for a further increase in\\nyouth mental ill-health since the mid-1990s was mixed ( 16,17);\\nhowever, there are increasing indications that this rise is real and\\nalarming in scale ( 18,19). Australia ’s national survey of mental health\\nrecently found that the 12-month prevalence of mental disorders (i.e.,\\nanxiety, affective and substance use disorders) among young people\\nhad increased by 50% over the past 15 years, disproportionately\\naffecting females ( 20). The prevalence of depression among young\\nadults in Australia has more than doubled over the past 14 years,\\naccording to data from the 2007 and 2020 –21 National Survey of\\nMental Health and Wellbeing ( 21). The 12-month prevalence of\\naffective disorders, including major depressive disorder, dysthymia,',\n"," 'and bipolar disorder, increased signi ﬁcantly from 6.3% to 13.6%\\namong those aged 16 –24, and from 7.9% to 11.0% among those aged\\n25–34, between 2007 and 2020 –21 (21). However, according to Liu\\net al. ( 22)’s secondary data analysis of the 2019 Global Burden of\\nDisease study, the annual incidence of anxiety disorders in children\\nand adolescents (10-19 years) decreased by 2.2% from 1990 to 2019, a\\ntrend observed primarily before COVID-19 and largely driven by\\nreductions in middle- to low-i ncome countries. There were\\nsigniﬁcant variations in the age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR)\\nand trends among countries. Despite a global decrease in adolescent\\nanxiety disorders over the past 30 years, developed countries continue\\nto see a steady increase in both incidence and disease burden. For\\nexample, Portugal had the highest ASIR, while Mexico saw the largest\\nincrease. In 2019, Portugal reported the highest number of DALYs',\n"," '(1001.71 million) followed by Ireland (897.80) and Iran (873.64), and\\nIndia the lowest (212.09 million) ( 22). Regarding eating disorders\\namong young people, referrals to child and adolescent services in the\\nUK have nearly doubled ( 23).\\nMechanisms underlying this surge remain poorly understood;\\nhowever, it is likely in ﬂuenced by a broad range of social and\\neconomic changes or “megatrends ”(e.g., increasing ﬁnancial\\ninsecurity, family life, educational experiences, and rising health\\nand social inequality) ( 24). In this review, we focus on the\\ntransitional life stage of youth (adolescence and young\\nadulthood). We examine mental health trends relevant to anxiety,\\ndepression, psychological distress and wellbeing since the mid-1990s and explore potential explanatory factors associated with\\nprevalence changes.\\n2 Methods\\nA literature search using Medline (1946), PsycINFO (806) and\\nEmbase (1947) was conducted from inception to May 2023. The',\n"," 'search strategy included subject headings and free text terms:\\n(anxiety OR depression OR mental disorders OR mental health\\nOR mental illness OR psychiatric disorders OR psychopathology)\\nAND (youth OR young people OR young person OR young adult\\nOR adolescence OR teenage) AND (epidemiology OR prevalence\\nOR time trends). A new search was carried in June 2024 to include\\nnew publications: Medline (262), PsycINFO (175) and Embase\\n(281). This search strategy included the aforementioned terms as\\nwell as additional terms such as psychosis, eating disorder, and\\nbipolar disorder. Both the search strategies were combined with\\nadditional search terms for various sections of this review: causal\\nexplanation, determinants, economy, inequality, politics, political\\nleadership, climate change, terrorism, urbanization, globalization,\\neducation, employment, unemployment, labour market, structural\\nchange, social change, social media, internet, technology, society,',\n"," 'trauma, victimization, development, individualism, materialism,\\nexpectations, family, culture, COVID, COVID-19, 2019-nCoV,\\nSARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, and corona virus. Searches were\\naugmented by Google Scholar, reviewing the reference lists of\\nrelevant studies, and by seminal publications known to the authors.\\nPrimary or secondary studies were selected if they included young\\npeople aged 12 –25 years and examined trends relevant to anxiety and\\ndepression, psychosis, suicidal beh aviours/thoughts, eating disorders\\n(ED), Schizophrenia and mood disorders, with at least one time point\\nafter 1995 (i.e., following the publication of Rutter and Smith ’s\\nmonograph). These included studies reporting trends in relation to\\npsychological distress, psycho logical wellbeing, and somatic,\\ninternalising and emotional sympt oms. Studies using administrative\\nor health service data were exclude d. Two reviewers selected articles\\nidenti ﬁed from the database searches, with one reviewer covering the',\n"," 'period from inception to May 2023 and the other from May 2023 to\\nJune 2024. Results were summarised according to trends in youth\\nmental health and potential explanatory factors associated with\\nprevalence changes. The percentage of increase or decrease in\\nprevalence is reported when these data were available.\\nThe searches up to May 2023 returned a combined total of 12,047\\nresults after duplicates were removed. Of the 177 full-text papers\\nretrieved, 72 met the criteria for inclusion and were included. The\\nnew search strategy yielded a combined total of 373 after duplicates\\nwere removed. Out of 122 full-te xt papers retrieved, 11 met the\\ninclusion criteria, bringing the t otal number of included studies to 83.\\nSix additional studies were identi ﬁed following the database searches,\\nthus a total of 89 studies.

Due to small sample sizes, it was not possible to further\\nsubdivide the data by disorder or by year.\\n3 Results\\n3.1 Youth mental health trends\\nOf the 89 studies included, 33% (n=29) were based in Europe,\\n29% (n=26) in North America, 13% (n=12) in the UK, 7% (n=6) in\\nAustralia, 6% (n=5) in Asia, 2% (n=2) in New Zealand, 1% (n=1) in\\neach of South America, and Iran, and 7% (n=6) were multinational.\\nOnly 4% (n=4) were undertaken with populations from low- and\\nmiddle-income countries. 79 (89%) were primary studies, of which\\n60 (76%) were nationally or geographically representative.\\nMost studies (80%, n=71) reported an increase in at least one\\noutcome related to anxiety, depression , psychological distress, wellbeing\\nor emotional, internalising or somatic symptoms, psychosis, suicidal\\nbehaviours/thoughts, eating disorders (ED), Schizophrenia and mood\\ndisorders ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The remaining studies reported a',\n"," 'decreasing trend (7%, n=6) or no increase (13%, n=12). Trends\\naccording to type of mental health problem suggest rising rates of\\nanxiety (15/18 studies), depression (26/37 studies), emotional or\\ninternalising problems (20/27 studies), somatic symptoms (8/9\\nstudies), psychological distress (9/14 studies), low mental wellbeing\\n(7/9 studies), suicidal be haviours/thoughts (3/3 st udies), Psychosis (1/2\\nstudies), ED (1/1 studies), and Schizophrenia and mood disorders (1/1\\nstudies) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Methodological differences between\\nstudies (e.g., outcome measures, sampling method and sample\\ncharacteristics) are a probable explanation for the variation in trends.\\nThe degree of increase varied within and across nations. The\\nproportion of young people experiencing anxiety increased by 29 –84%\\nin the US ( 25,26), 77 –164% in Sweden ( 27,28), 105% in Australia ( 20,29), and 115% in Canada ( 30). Severe anxiety increased by 86% in the',\n"," 'US ( 31) and high levels of anxiety doubled in Iceland ( 32). For\\ndepressive symptoms or disorder, the percentage of increase was\\n8%–119% in the US ( 33–42) and 87% in Australia ( 43). Severe\\ndepression rose by 145% in the US ( 31), while the change was\\nmodest in Finland (+18%) ( 44). The proportion of young people\\nwith emotional or internalising problems increased by 25 –79% in the\\nNetherlands and Nordic countries ( 45–48), 43% in Canada ( 49), 48%\\nin New Zealand ( 50), 55 –61% in the UK ( 51,52), and 10%-64% in\\nPoland ( 53,54). For psychological distress, the percentage of increase\\nwas modest to large: 43 –135% in the UK ( 55–58), 12 –70% in the US\\n(33,37), and 7%-47% in Ethiopia ( 59). In the UK, severe psychological\\ndistress tripled ( 58). Somatic symptoms increased by 25 –54% in the\\nNetherlands ( 45,48), while low wellbeing rose by 119% in the US ( 31)\\nand 118% in Denmark ( 60). Rates of suicide increased from 3.6- 7.1',\n"," '(per 100, 000) in Asian American and Paci ﬁc Islander (AAPI) youth in\\nthe US ( 61), ED increased by 5% per month from 2017-2021 ( 62), and\\nSchizophrenia and mood disorders increased by 4% per month ( 62).\\nThere are indications that trends have risen since 2011 –2016 for\\npsychological distress, low mental wellbeing, and depressive and\\nanxiety symptoms ( 6,31,32,34,39,41,42,58,63–67). Since 2020/\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, rates of psychological distress, anxiety\\nand depressive symptoms have increased further, and mental\\nwellbeing has worsened ( 56–58,60,68–70).\\nIncreasing trends were not observed in Canada, New Zealand,\\nEngland, China, Netherlands, and Chile for depression; Belgium\\nand Japan for psychological distress; Poland for somatic symptoms;\\nthe UK for low wellbeing; and Scotland, Switzerland and Iran for\\ninternalising symptoms. However, for each of these locations\\n(except the UK and Canada), only one study was available for the',\n"," 'corresponding outcome. Where declining trends were reported, the\\npercentage of decrease was 22% for depression ( 71) and 6 –29% for\\ndistress ( 72,73).\\nFIGURE 2\\nTime trends of youth mental health disorders from 1996-2023.McGorry et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1517533\\nFrontiers in Psychiatry frontiersin.org 04',\n"," 'Trends in relation to gender suggest greater increases among\\nfemales for anxiety, depression, distress, emotional problems,\\npsychosis, and internalising symptoms ( 31,34,37,39,63,74–78).\\nHowever, some studies have reported increases for both genders in\\nrelation to anxiety, depression and emotional problems ( 28,38,49,\\n51,54,77,79,80) or higher increase for males for psychological\\ndistress ( 81), and low mental wellbeing ( 82). These discrepancies\\nacross similar outcomes likely re ﬂect methodological heterogeneity,\\nparticularly in terms of outcome measure, which varied across\\nstudies. Also, outcomes of this review may not have detected\\nnon-speci ﬁc symptoms (e.g., irritability, anger, and risk-taking)\\nthat may represent gender-speci ﬁc markers of distress in young\\nmen ( 83).\\nFigure 2 illustrates the trends in youth mental health disorders\\nfrom 1996 to 2023 (the most recent years of observation in the\\nstudies reviewed). The ﬁgure shows a declining trend from 1996 to',\n"," '2015, followed by an increase starting in 2016. The effect of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022) is unclear from this ﬁgure at\\nleast, and it appears that the increase from 2016 is dif ﬁcult to\\nexplain on that basis.\\n3.2 The social, economic, and commercial\\ndeterminants of mental health\\nSocial determinants of mental health refer to the structural\\nconditions individuals are exposed to throughout their lives, from\\nconception to death ( 86). These conditions affect mental health\\noutcomes and contribute to disparities within and between\\npopulations. Key factors include income, employment,\\nsocioeconomic status, education, food security, housing, social\\nsupport, discrimination, childhood adversity, neighbourhood\\nconditions, and access to affordable health care ( 87–89). The\\nlikelihood of encountering protecti ve or harmful social determinants\\nis inﬂuenced by the distribution of money, power, and resources at\\nglobal, national, and local levels, shaped by policy choices ( 86).',\n"," 'The impact of mental health issues is particularly evident\\namong young people. Young people have high rates of self-harm,\\nand suicide is a leading cause of death among them ( 90,91). Poor\\nmental health is closely linked to other signi ﬁcant health and\\ndevelopmental concerns, such a s educational achievements,\\nsubstance use and abuse, violence, and reproductive and sexual\\nhealth ( 37). Poor mental health can hinder life chances, impacting\\nboth lifespan and quality of life. Therefore, improving young\\npeople ’s mental health by addressing modi ﬁable social risk factors\\nthrough effective prevention strategies is a critical social\\njustice issue.\\nCommercial determinants of health, a relatively new area of\\nstudy, highlight how corporate actions, conditions, and omissions\\nsigniﬁcantly impact health ( 92). Young people are especially\\nvulnerable to advertisements and celebrity endorsements.

Most studies to date\\nhave examined correlation rather than causation. An exploratory\\nreview of potential proximal and distal factors associated with trends\\nis provided in the following sections. Proximal factors re ﬂect those\\nwithin the young person ’s immediate environment: developmental\\nchanges, family, education, health and lifestyle, social media,\\nchildhood trauma, and bullying ( 86,98). Distal factors re ﬂect\\nbroader societal contexts, which are often related to and mediated',\n"," 'by proximal factors: economy, socio-economic disadvantage and\\ninequality, politics, and climate change ( 86,101). This review\\nconsiders the in ﬂuence of both proximal and distal factors, largely\\nrelated to Western and high-income countries, structuring the\\ndiscussion based on Kirkbride ( 86)’s framework of social\\ndeterminants. This framework in cludes individual-level social\\ndeterminants (i.e. proximal) and broader environmental\\ndeterminants (i.e. distal).\\n3.2.1.1 Individual level social determinants\\n3.2.1.1.1 Developmental trends\\nThis section explores developmental trends that in ﬂuence youth\\nmental health, including factors such as family environment,\\neducation, health and lifestyle, experiences of abuse or neglect,\\nbullying and cyberbullying, and the role of social media.\\n3.2.1.1.2 Family environment\\nWith respect to family structure, while there has been an\\nincrease in the proportion of young people not living with both',\n"," 'biological parents, this has not been associated with increasing rates\\nof psychological distress ( 72,102), depressive symptoms or disorder\\n(43,79), and emotional problems ( 76). On the other hand, it may\\nhave retarded the maturational process of attaining independent\\nidentity and adult status. Parent-adolescent arguments have been\\nfound to explain a large proportion of the rise in self-reported\\nadolescent psychological distress, although reverse causality could\\nnot be eliminated and the survey items used to measure arguments\\ndiffered at the two time points ( 102). Based on two large nationalMcGorry et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1517533\\nFrontiers in Psychiatry frontiersin.org 05',\n"," 'surveys using identical measu res of adolescent and parent\\nemotional problems over a 20-year period, increases in maternal\\nemotional problems were found to modestly contribute to\\nincreasing rates of adolescent emotional problems ( 103). This was\\nbased on three key ﬁndings: maternal and adolescent emotional\\nproblems increasing at the same time; parental emotional problems\\nprospectively predicting offspring emotional problems, beyond\\nreverse causation and in ﬂuences of shared adversity; and cohort\\ndifferences in adolescent emotional problems were attenuated when\\ncontrolling for trends in parental emotional problems. Armitage\\net al. ( 104) posits that these trends in family structure have not\\nsigniﬁcantly impacted trends in youth mental health, as similar\\nincreases in adolescent emotional problems are observed across\\ndifferent family structures ( 103,105,106). While they may not\\naccount for the rise, family environment and structure are still an',\n"," 'important in ﬂuence, and equally, efforts to alleviate childhood\\npoverty, food insecurity, and family homelessness are critical for\\naddressing these social deter minants of mental health among\\nyoung people.\\n3.2.1.1.3 Education\\nEducational reforms in the UK and many other countries have\\nled to increased grading and testing, which signi ﬁcantly contributes\\nto student anxiety and stress ( 104). Studies report rising school-\\nrelated stress, academic pressure, and burnout among adolescents,\\nwith notable variation across countries ( 107–111). Female\\nadolescents are particularly aff ected, showing increased worry\\nabout academic performance, contributing to a widening gender\\ngap around 50% for internalising problems ( 102,112). Studies that\\nhave compared trends between students and non-students indicate\\nvariation across countries and genders. A meta-analysis across 57\\nnations found an overall increase in anxiety among both students',\n"," 'and non-students between 1970 and 2010; however, when analysed\\naccording to country (US, Australia, UK, Canada), only students inthe US showed a signi ﬁcant increase ( 113). Recent data from\\nEngland (2000 –2014) suggest that only female students have\\nshown increases in common mental disorders, although the\\nsample was relatively small ( 114). There is little experimental\\nevidence as to why rates have increased among some students,\\nparticularly females. Hypotheses include rising tuition fees, student\\ndebt ( 113,114) and increasing educational expectations or\\npressures that have impacted females ( 75,108,115), which when\\ncombined with other stressors (e.g., concerns about personal\\nidentity), has led to an accumulation of risk factors for mental ill-\\nhealth ( 115). While these trends indicate increased anxiety and\\nmental health issues among students, particularly females, the\\nevidence is complex and varies across countries, necessitating',\n"," 'further research to unravel the underlying causes, causal\\nsequence, and implications.\\n3.2.1.1.4 Health and lifestyle\\nIndicators of health that are commonly associated with mental\\nill-health have similarly declined; however, their impact on youth\\nmental health trends is unclear. The vaping epidemic exempli ﬁes\\nhow social factors impact substance use, with electronic nicotine\\ndelivery systems (ENDS) popular among youth due to targetedmarketing and social media in ﬂuence ( 116,117). Youth with mental\\nillness may use ENDS to manage symptoms or medication side\\neffects, contributing to conditions like depression, ADHD, and\\nconduct disorder ( 93). Sleep disturbances have risen, which has\\nbeen linked to electronic device usage ( 118). Physical activity has\\ndeclined, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic ( 119). While\\nobesity rates have risen, this has not been associated with increasing\\nrates of distress ( 102). There has been a notable increase in the',\n"," 'percentage of females in the clinical range for mental health and\\nsubstance use among Finnish young people ( 120). The effect of\\nurbanisation on anxiety and depression trends is mixed and limited\\nby differences in measures of urbanisation and the con ﬂation other\\noutcomes (e.g., conduct disorders) ( 49,53).\\nIn contrast, several studies have found that some lifestyle trends\\nhave positively improved for adolescents, with signs of decreasing\\nalcohol consumption, illicit drug use, and risky behaviour ( 47,\\n121–125). While alcohol use has declin ed among Generation Z, there\\nhas been a rise in the use of substances such as cannabis, which is now\\nmore potent and readily available ( 126,127). An increase in depressive\\nsymptoms in Norway was partly attributed to increases in cannabis use\\na n dd i s o r d e r e de a t i n g( 79).\\n3.2.1.1.5 Abuse or neglect experiences\\nAt present there are no direct links between population changes',\n"," 'in youth mental health and exposure to violence, abuse and neglect.\\nWhile childhood maltreatment is common and remains a major\\npublic health concern, stable ( 128) and, in some instances, decreasing\\ntrends in exposure to violence and abuse ( 122,129–131) cautiously\\nindicate that these factors may not be likely candidates to account for\\nthe rise in prevalence of disorders. However, this requires robust\\ninvestigation across the various types of maltreatment as increases in\\nemotional abuse and neglect have been reported ( 132).\\n3.2.1.1.6 Bullying and cyberbullying\\nStudies indicate that the impact of being bullied surpasses the\\neffects of other childhood adversities and adult abuse ( 133,134).\\nWhile bullying victimisation has shown a downward trend in most\\nEuropean countries ( 135,136), increasing trends have been\\nobserved in the UK ( 135,137). In Scotland, increasing rates of\\nvictimisation have been linked to a decline in the mental wellbeing',\n"," 'of adolescents ( 137). While cyberbullying victimization has\\nremained stable ( 136) or increased among adolescents ( 138–140),\\nit has negatively impacted mental health. This suggests that both\\nbullying and cyberbullying victimization are indicators of comorbid\\nmental health problems ( 136). Conversely, a rise in cyberbullying in\\n2020 occurred in the absence of increasing anxiety and depressive\\nsymptoms ( 141). According to Patchin and Hinduj ( 142), the\\nproportion of individuals who have experienced cyberbullying at\\nsome point in their lives has more than doubled over the years.\\nProtecting youth from bullying and its detrimental effects is crucial,\\nnecessitating safe, respectful, and inclusive school environments\\nthat do not tolerate such behaviour.\\n3.2.1.1.7 Digital media/social media\\nThe digital world offers youth avenues for connection, creativity,\\nand support, but also carries signi ﬁcant risks.

These ﬁndings are limited by the broad categories used',\n"," 'to measure usage (e.g., ‘almost every day ’), which do not capture the\\nvariance in this variable given that the majority of young people use\\nsocial media daily ( 150). Other studies using the same surveys\\nanalysed by Twenge et al. indicate a small correlation between\\nsocial media usage and both depressive symptoms and wellbeing\\n(150–152) and that social media explained only 4% of the increase in\\ndepressive symptoms ( 150). Furthermore, between 2009 and 2017,\\nthe association between social media usage and depressive symptoms\\nwas found to be weak and con ﬁned to only 2009 –2010 ( 152).\\n3.2.1.2 Wider social environmental determinants\\n3.2.1.2.1 Economic trends\\nThis section explores economic trends, including the labour and\\nhousing markets, socio-economi c disadvantage and inequality,\\nclimate change, and political factors, all of which impact youth\\nmental health.\\n3.2.1.2.2 Labour market/unemployment\\nThe impacts of the 2008 global ﬁnancial crisis on young people',\n"," 'were substantial and included insecure employment and income\\n(153–157). These trends have relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic\\n(see below). In Southern Europe, cross-sectional repeated surveys\\nspanning before and after the 2008 recession showed that\\nsymptoms of anxiety and depression increased among students\\n(potentially due to limited employment prospects) ( 158) and that\\nthese symptoms among young people have become more strongly\\nassociated with insecure employment (e.g., ﬁxed term contracts)\\nfollowing the recession ( 159). Across the working-age population,\\nyoung Australians (15 –24 years) have shown the largest decrease in\\nmental health and wellbeing and increase in high/very high\\nsymptoms of psychologica l distress since 2010 ( 160). This\\ncoincided with an increase in insecure employment, inadequacy\\nof pay, and the casualisation of the youth labour force.\\nIn the US, no association was found between rising adolescent\\ndepressive symptoms and the overall unemployment rate',\n"," 'immediately after the 2008 recession ( 63). However, when labour\\nmarket trends have been measured speci ﬁcally in relation to young\\npeople, an association has been found between increases in the\\nproportion of young people not in the workforce and increases in\\nmental health symptoms among adolescents (feeling low, headache\\nand sleep dif ﬁculties) between 1983 and 2005 ( 161). This lends\\nsome support to the ﬁnding that proximal (i.e., adolescents ’worryabout family ﬁnances) rather than societal level factors (i.e., overall\\nmunicipality unemployment rate) are more strongly associated with\\nincreasing psychosomatic symptoms among adolescents during a\\np e r i o do fe c o n o m i cd o w n t u r ni nS w e d e n( 5). However, the\\ndirection of causality remains unclear. As somewhat expected,\\nlittle evidence was found to support the role of economic\\nvariables (e.g., no working parent, worry about unemployment) in\\nexplaining increases in psychological distress in Scottish adolescents',\n"," 'during a period of reduced economic hardship ( 102). Moreover, the\\npandemic seemed to have affected school engagement among young\\npeople. For instance, symptoms of anxiety decreased from pre-\\npandemic levels to during the ﬁrst UK lockdown but increased\\nupon the return to school for 13-14-year-olds ( 162). These ﬁndings\\nunderscore the complex and context-dependent relationship\\nbetween economic instability, insecurity of work, youth mental\\nhealth, and factors like school engagement during the pandemic,\\nhighlighting how both direct experiences of economic hardship and\\nbroader economic conditions can variably impact mental\\nhealth outcomes.\\n3.2.1.2.3 Housing market\\nHousing market and economic trends have contributed to a\\ngeneration of young people who frequently face residing with\\nparents for longer or living in unaffordable and insecure rentals\\n(154). Economic downturns negatively impact young people ’s\\nmental health, with effects comparable across different economic',\n"," 'indicators like unemployment rates and housing prices ( 163).\\nGolberstein et al. ( 163), found that a decline in unemployment\\nrates (2001-2013) in the US is associated with a reduction in the\\nseverity of mental health problems in children and adolescents (4-\\n17 years), similar to the impact on adult health outcomes.\\nConversely, a ﬁve-percentage point increase in unemployment\\nduring the Great Recession was linked to a 35% to 50% increase\\nin clinically signi ﬁcant mental health issues among these age groups\\n(163). Home-ownership rates among young adults have decreased\\n(154,164) amid stagnant wages, unstable employment conditions\\nand dramatically increasing house prices ( 165). This has negatively\\nimpacted the mental health of adult renters ( 166). Young people\\nwho rent fear that housing security and wealth are unattainable and\\nhave reported feeling anxious , depressed and stressed due to\\ninsecure, expensive and poor-quality housing, and rising rental',\n"," 'costs have added to this precarious situation for many ( 167).\\n3.2.1.2.4 Socio-economic disadvantage and inequality\\nSocio-economic and intergenerational inequalities have been\\nincreasing since the 1990s in most high-income countries ( 168,\\n169). Today ’s young people are not only struggling more than older\\ngenerations, but they are also worse off compared to previous\\ngenerations at the same age and are expected to face greater\\nchallenges as seniors than the current over-65s ( 170). A global\\nstudy by ( 171), using data between 2009-2022, has shown that\\nrelative inequality in youth wellbeing has worsened, with emotional\\ndistress and life satisfaction becoming increasingly unequal between\\nsocioeconomic groups. This suggests that growing income\\ndisparities are intensifying relative inequality across generations,\\nleaving today ’s youth more disadvantaged compared to previousMcGorry et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1517533\\nFrontiers in Psychiatry frontiersin.org 07',\n"," 'generations ( 171). In the UK, a comparison of three nationally\\nrepresentative cohorts with comparable data revealed a widening\\ndisparity in emotional problems according to level of family income,\\nwith a fourfold increase for adolescents in the lowest income group\\nbetween 1974 and 1999/2004 ( 172). This was partially accounted for\\nby the increasing impact of socio-economic adversity (e.g., insecure\\nhousing tenure), mediated by adolescents ’proximal family\\nenvironment. Increasing social inequalities have similarly been\\nobserved in relation to rising rates of depression in Finland and\\nthe US ( 6,44). In Japan, a nation with higher levels of equality than\\nmost others, psychological distress among adolescents decreased\\nsigniﬁcantly from 10.7% to 7.6% between 2007 and 2013 ( 72).\\nHowever, the patterns of psych ological distress relative to\\nsocioeconomic status remained consistent throughout the study\\nperiod. Adolescents in both low er-income and higher-income',\n"," 'households reported more psycho logical distress compared to\\nthose in middle-income households. Conversely, ﬁndings from\\nDenmark indicate that the larg est increases in emotional\\nsymptoms have occurred in high and middle socio-economic\\nclasses ( 46); however, a substantial proportion of cases with\\nemotional problems had missing socio-economic status data,\\nwhich may have skewed ﬁndings. Data from the US suggest\\nincreasing rates of major depressive episode in adolescents\\nbetween 2005 and 2017 across all income levels, although\\ninequalities remained as those in the lowest income group\\nexperienced higher annual rates of major depressive episode than\\nthe highest income group ( 37).\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic crisis\\nhave exacerbated inequality among vulnerable and disadvantaged\\ngroups, including young people ( 173). During the pandemic, young\\npeople have experienced increased rates of educational disruption,',\n"," 'unemployment or precarious employment, ﬁnancial insecurity, and\\nhousing stress ( 173,174). Young people of lower socio-economic\\nstatus have experienced greater economic hardship ( 174). This\\nampli ﬁcation of socio-economic determinants of mental health\\nand of inequality has likely contributed to an increase in anxiety\\nand depression that has disproportionately affected young people\\n(15,68,174–176).\\n3.2.1.2.5 Climate change\\nThere is increasing evidence of climate change impacts on\\nyoung people ’s mental health who are a priority population group\\nin the context of climate change. These include anxiety, sadness,\\ngrief, hopelessness, powerlessne ss, depression, and existential\\nworries about the future ( 177–180). A range of factors including\\ngovernment inaction on climate change, social media exposure, and\\nsocial challenges such as housing instability, food insecurity, and\\nincreased con ﬂict in ﬂuence this relationship between climate',\n"," 'change and young people ’s mental health ( 177,178,181–183).\\nAccording to Sciberras & Fernando ( 184)’se i g h t - y e a r\\nlongitudinal study which focused on climate change worry among\\nAustralian adolescents found that adolescents with high levels of\\nworry related to climate change that are persistent over time showed\\nhigher rates of depressive symptoms in late adolescence than\\nadolescents with moderate levels of climate change related worry.\\nAlthough 50% of young people have experienced a negativeemotional response to climate change ( 185), a causal relationship\\nand time trends between climate-related negative emotions and\\nmental ill-health in young people has yet to be fully established\\n(186). There has been one study that looked at the causal\\nrelationship between climate change and mental health. Patrick\\net al. ( 183)’s systems dynamics study developed a systems map\\nhighlighting the relationships between causal factors (e.g. under',\n"," 'theme areas of government, services and structures, personal\\nexperience of environmental disasters, and social norms,\\ncommunication and taking action). While the nature of causal\\nrelationships requires further investigation, higher temperatures\\nhave been associated with increased suicide rates ( 187) and lower\\nmental wellbeing ( 188).\\n3.2.1.2.6 Politics\\nAlthough anxiety surrounding political elections and decision-\\nmaking is not a recent phenomenon, there is concern about the\\nimpact of recent and current political landscapes ( 189). Both\\nimmediate and potential future negative effects on youth mental\\nhealth have been observed. This includes increased stress and anxiety\\nduring the 2016 presidential election in America ( 190,191);\\nincreasing concern in the UK because of the Brexit vote and its\\nuncertain consequences, particularly on employment and education\\n(192); and social unrest in Hong Kong that has been independently',\n"," 'associated with depressive symptoms ( 193). Gimbrone et al. ( 194)’s\\nstudy (2005-2018) highlights a growing mental health disparity (e.g.\\ndepressive symptoms) among adolescents based on their political\\nbeliefs. The ﬁndings suggest that the ideological perspectives through\\nwhich adolescents interpret the political climate can have varying\\nimpacts on their mental well-being.\\n4 Discussion\\nTheﬁndings of this review indicate a substantial rise in youth\\nmental health issues including anxiet y, psychological distress, self-\\nharm, suicide, and depressive symptoms, contributing to a global\\nyouth mental health crisis a s highlighted by a recent Lancet\\nCommission on youth mental health ( 14). The magnitude of change\\nvaried within and across nations and was not observed in some studies.\\nHowever, in others, it was substantia l, with the percentage of increase\\nas high as 164% for anxiety, 135% for psychological distress (increasing\\nto 242% for severe distress), and 119% for both depression and low',\n"," 'wellbeing (increasing to 145% for se vere depression). An important\\nconsideration is whether increasing trends re ﬂect a real population\\nchange or are an artefact arising from reduced stigma, improved\\nmental health awareness, greater wi llingness to disclose mental health\\nissues, a widening of diagnostic th resholds, and population growth\\n(195–197). These factors might contribute to an in ﬂation of prevalence\\nrates by capturing individuals with transient distress that does not\\nnecessarily require clinical intervention ( 198). Additionally, the role of\\ncultural and societal shifts, such as the in ﬂuence of digital media and\\nthe pressures of modern life, may co ntribute to these trends, making it\\nessential to consider both the real and perceived changes in mental\\nhealth across generations ( 199). However, these factors contributing to\\nincreasing trends in youth mental health remain unclear andMcGorry et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1517533\\nFrontiers in Psychiatry frontiersin.org 08',\n"," 'individually only explain a small pro portion of the increasing trend and\\nthe interpretation of ﬁndings and causal inferences are limited by\\nmethodological constraints (e.g., unmeasured cofounders or co-\\noccurring social changes, lack of harmonised measures across studies\\nand, in some instances, timepoints) as identi ﬁed in the review.\\nAlthough potential shifts in respondent reporting and diagnostic\\napproaches have been dif ﬁcult to unequivocally refute, Twenge et al.\\n(200) found that increases in psychopathology were not explained by a\\ngreater willingness to report mental health problems after controlling\\nfor socially acceptable and defensiv e responding. Further validation of a\\ntrue rise can also be provided from related rising trends, including\\nincreased rates of suicide ( 28,63), co-occurring functional impairment\\n(36,74), and mental health service use ( 28,30,71,201,202).\\nAccording to the ﬁndings of this review, over time, several social',\n"," 'and commercial determinants have shown varying trends in their\\nimpact on youth mental health. increasing trends are observed in\\nareas such as the instability and identity explorations associated\\nwith adolescent and emerging adulthood, homelessness and\\nhousing insecurity, cyberbul lying, social media usage, and\\neconomic precarity, particula rly in insecure employment.\\nConversely, there are decreasing trends in certain substance use,\\nbullying victimization, and exposure to violence and abuse, though\\nthe latter also shows some stability. Mixed or stable trends are noted\\nin areas like family structure, educational stress, urbanization, and\\nthe impact of maternal emotional problems.\\nGiven the current context of the aftermath of the COVID-19\\npandemic, many of these factors, particularly socio-economic\\ninequality and climate change, will likely be exacerbated in the\\ncoming years ( 203,204).

This has extended\\nthe period of heightened susceptibil ity to environmental stressors and\\nmental ill-health. This lengthening of adolescence commenced prior to\\nthe recorded rise in youth mental ill-health in the 1990s ( 1). While its\\nimpact on more recent trends is unclear, it has converged with\\neducational, labour market and economic shifts (e.g., prolonged years',\n"," 'of education; insecure employment, income and housing; and delayed\\nindependence) that have contribute d to highly precarious pathways to\\nadulthood ( 113,159,163,167). Emerging adulthood is a heightened\\nperiod of instability and identity explorations, which have been correlated\\nwith anxiety ( 210). Increasing and cumulative exposure to psychosocial\\nstressors during this period of precarity may have increased the risk of\\nmental ill-health and contrib uted to deteriorating trends ( 13,98,211).H o w e v e r ,t h es a l i e n c ea n di m p a c to ft h e s ei n ﬂuences are likely to vary\\nacross different cultural settings, as well as in relation to levels of wealth\\nand development around the wealth ( 212,213).\\nVarious opinions and theories have emerged to examine and\\nevaluate the candidate causes of negative trends in youth mental\\nhealth. For example, Twenge ( 118,214) and Haidt ( 143) argue that\\nthe rise of social media and increased screen time are the dominant',\n"," 'contributors to the deterioration in mental health among young\\npeople, suggesting that these factors lead to heightened anxiety,\\ndepression, and social isolation. Twenge ’s research points to a\\ncorrelation between the advent of smartphones and a decline in\\nadolescent mental health ( 215). Haidt ( 143)’sThe Anxious\\nGeneration proposes a stronger relationship between the rise in\\nsocial media use and deteriorating mental health among young\\npeople, positing that the increased screen time and social\\ncomparison are major contributors to the surge in anxiety and\\ndepression. While Haidt ( 143)’s work has brought signi ﬁcant\\nattention to this issue, it has also been critiqued for potentially\\noveremphasising the role of social media at the expense of other\\nsociocultural and economic factors that may contribute to youth\\nmental health trends. Additionally, the reliance on correlational\\ndata in Haidt ( 143)’s argument, limits the ability to draw de ﬁnitive',\n"," 'conclusions about causality. Thus, support for a causal link between\\nsocial media usage and increasing depressive symptoms and low\\nwellbeing is limited and requires further investigation using more\\nrobust measures of social media use. Despite this, politicians in\\nseveral jurisdictions have been persuaded to implement age linked\\nrestrictions on access to the internet and social media for teenagers\\n(216). Such action can be argued to be misdirected, lacking in\\nnuance and to produce unintended consequences ( 217–219). This\\nregulatory gap has allowed platforms to prioritize engagement and\\nproﬁt over the well-being of their users, particularly vulnerable\\npopulations like young people. Odgers ( 220)a r g u e st h a ta g e\\nrestrictions and mobile device bans may prove ineffective —or\\neven counterproductive —considering what is known about\\nadolescent behaviour. Regulation of the social media platforms to\\nmake them safer would be a more appropriate response.',\n"," 'Wilkinson and Pickett ( 175)’s work highlights the role of socio-\\neconomic inequality, emphasizing how growing disparities and\\neconomic stressors exacerbate mental health issues. Focusing on a\\ndeeper level, the economic doctrine of neoliberalism, which has\\ndominated the political economy of the globe since the 1980s, can\\nalso be hypothesised to be a common force underpinning many of\\nthese trends in youth mental health and indeed wider effects on\\nsociety ( 86,221). Neoliberalism, with its promotion of\\nindividualism over collectivism and the common good, market\\nderegulation, privatization, a weakened role and respect for\\ngovernment and even democracy, reduced government\\nintervention erosion of the welfare state, creates an environment\\nwhere young people face heightened economic pressures, social\\ninequalities, and reduced and fragmented health and social safety\\nnets ( 169,222).

These studies should\\nincorporate comparable measures of potential explanatory factors.\\nBy collecting data on a wide range of explanatory factors such as\\nsocial media usage, economic precarity, and educational pressure,\\nand performing sophisticated multivariate regression analyses, it\\nmay be possible to quantify their potential individual and combined\\neffects on mental health outcomes ( 229).\\nCausality could be guided by criteria such as temporality,\\nstrength and consistency of a ssociation, and dose-response\\nrelation ( 230). How these variables interact, and their cumulative',\n"," 'effects on mental health require exploration in addition to\\nidentifying protective factors. For example, path analysis\\n(231,232), systems dynamics ( 233), and structural equation\\nmodelling (SEM) ( 234,235) model complex relationships between\\nvariables to identify direct and indirect pathways in ﬂuencing\\nmental health. Using advanced statistical software to construct\\nSEM models that include multiple variables and pathways can\\nprovide a detailed understanding of how different factors interact\\nto affect mental health ( 234). Additionally, big data and machine\\nlearning can analyze large datasets to identify patterns and\\npredictors of mental health outcomes ( 236–238). Collecting and\\nanalyzing big data from sources such as social media, health\\nrecords, and surveys, and using machine learning techniques, can\\nuncover trends and predictive factors for youth mental health ( 237).\\nConducting comprehensive literature searches, systematic',\n"," 'reviews, and meta-analyses can summarize ﬁndings, assess the\\nrelative importance of different candidate causes, and identify\\noverall trends and patterns ( 239).

This may guide the identi ﬁcation of new at-risk\\npopulations and can inform preventive and early intervention\\nstrategies where modi ﬁable factors are targeted and their effect on\\ntrends are monitored ( 243,244). Intervention studies can offer a\\nstarting point to implementing and evaluating interventions aimed',\n"," 'at addressing identi ﬁed risk factors and improving mental health\\noutcomes ( 245,246). Designing and testing interventions, such as\\nschool-based mental health programs or community support\\ninitiatives and measuring their effectiveness through stepped\\nwedge, cluster and other forms of randomized controlled trials or\\nother rigorous evaluation methods, can provide more robust\\nevidence for effective strategies ( 247).\\nImproving the measurement of cross-sectoral impacts of mental\\nhealth prevention and treatme n tc o s t sr e q u i r e si n n o v a t i v e\\nmethodologies. By expanding the scope of economic evaluations\\nto include broader cost perspectives and utilizing cost-bene ﬁt and\\nreturn on investment analyses, decision makers can gain valuable\\ninsights that extend beyond the healthcare sector ( 14).

Key players in this effort\\ninclude communities, families, schools, and digital platforms. To\\neffectively reduce the incidence and severity of mental health\\ndisorders, it is recommended to strengthen community support\\nby fostering social connections and providing essential resources,\\nwhich can act as protective factors against mental health issues\\n(199,252–254). Studies have shown a positive relationship between\\nhigh-quality social relationships and subjective well-being across all\\nages ( 255). These ﬁndings indicate that the quality of relationships\\nis more crucial than the quantity. However, having a large and\\ndiverse social network also provides protection against depression\\n(255). High social support is important for adolescents who have\\nexperienced child maltreatment or other adversities and serves as aprotective factor for LGBTQ adolescents ( 256–258).\\nYouth mentoring programs, where an adult mentor provides',\n"," 'social support and engages in shared activities without offering\\npsychotherapeutic interventions, have been used to reduce the risk\\nof behavioural disorders among young people ( 259). Evidence\\nsuggests these programs can enhance social and emotional skills\\nand lower the risk of behavioural disorders, substance use, and\\ncriminal offending ( 259,260).\\nSchools should implement mental health programs that include\\nearly identi ﬁcation and intervention services, as these can\\nsigniﬁcantly improve student outcomes and address mental health\\nchallenges ( 261). Additionally, leveraging digital platforms to offer\\naccessible resources, psychoe ducation, peer support, and\\nconnections to mental health professionals can reduce symptoms\\nof anxiety and depression among young people ( 262). These\\nstrategies can be integrated across different levels of prevention:\\nUniversal prevention targets broad risk factors, protective\\nfactors, and megatrends for an entire population without regard',\n"," 'to individual risk factors. For example, integrating mental health\\neducation into school curricula helps to normalize discussionsabout mental health and provide students with tools for\\nmanaging stress and emotional challenges ( 261,263). This may\\nalso include school-based behavioral interventions to minimize risk\\nof bullying and peer rejection ( 264) as well as substance abuse ( 265).\\nConversely, the literature also suggests that universal interventions\\nmay be ineffective and, in some cases, potentially harmful ( 266,\\n267). For example, a systematic review of studies conducted in UK\\nmainstream schools found that school-based universal\\ninterventions targeting the promotion of emotional or mental\\nwellbeing, or the prevention of mental health dif ﬁculties\\ndemonstrated neutral to small effects ( 268).\\nThe identi ﬁcation of potent harmful megatrends strengthens',\n"," 'the momentum for and emphasis upon both universal and selectivepreventive strategies ( 14). However, even if the relative contribution\\nof these megatrends and new risk factors can be clari ﬁed, how\\nmalleable they will be is quite another question. It is likely to be not\\nmerely a scienti ﬁ\\nc one but a political and economic one which,\\nwhen posed, is likely to provoke controversy and resistance. It took\\nforty years for neoliberalism to displace Keynsian economic theory\\nand although there is an emerging case being mounted within the\\nﬁeld of progressive economics for a reengineering and\\nhumanization of capitalism in the service of the common good\\n(269,270), this will be resisted and would in any case take time.

Selective\\ninterventions are aimed at individuals who are at a signi ﬁcantly\\nhigher risk of developing a mental disorder compared to the general\\npopulation, despite being asymptomatic. For instance, targeted\\ninterventions for LGBTIQA+ youth can address unique stressors\\nFIGURE 3\\nModel of the spectrum of interventions for mental health problems and mental health disorders: Adapted from Rickwood ( 84) and Mrazek &\\nHaggerty ( 85).McGorry et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1517533\\nFrontiers in Psychiatry frontiersin.org 11',\n"," 'and reduce the risk of mental health issues ( 272). One might even\\nassert that a substantial proportion of young people are an at-risk\\nsegment of society and are already showing serious warning signs\\nahead of the remainder of society.\\nIndicated prevention transitions into early intervention,\\nproviding support for individuals showing early signs of mental\\nhealth issues. Programs that identify, treat and support young\\npeople with emerging mental health problems can prevent the\\nescalation of symptoms ( 90,273–275). Research suggests that\\nindicated interventions have successfully achieved their goals by\\nstrengthening service engagement, shortening the duration of\\nuntreated illness, and coordinating with secondary prevention\\nefforts ( 273,276). This is potentially a “sweet spot ”for most\\npotential health and economic gain and cost-effectiveness.\\nA balanced approach that integrates universal, selective, and\\nindicated prevention research and interventions is essential for',\n"," 'addressing the mental, physical and social needs of young\\npeople ( 277).\\n4.3.2 Early intervention\\nEarly intervention is considered a “best buy ”in healthcare due\\nto its cost-effectiveness and the substantial evidence supporting its\\nbeneﬁts (274). Integrated and enhanced primary care youth services\\noffer comprehensive support, addressing a range of mental health\\nissues before they become severe ( 278). The “Integrated Behavioural\\nHealth in Primary Care ”(IBHPC) model is an example, where\\nbehavioural health providers are embedded in primary care\\npractices to offer immediate support and referrals ( 279). These\\nservices are designed to provide comprehensive, accessible, and\\ncoordinated care for young people, integrating mental health\\nservices into primary care settings. For instance, headspace serves\\nas a model of Early Intervention, offering stigma-free, integrated\\nsupport for mental health, substance use, and vocational needs',\n"," 'while ensuring all help-seeking youth have access to care ( 14). This\\napproach aims to address mental health issues early and effectively,\\nleveraging the strengths of both primary care and specialized mental\\nhealth services. For example, early psychosis intervention has been a\\nfocus for several decades, providing specialized care for young\\npeople experiencing their ﬁrst episode of psychosis. This has now\\nexpanded to include transdiagno stic platforms of care, which\\naddress various mental heal th conditions within a uni ﬁed\\nframework ( 13).\\n4.3.3 Treatment, continuing care and\\nrecovery support\\nHolistic, evidence-based treatment approaches are essential for\\nsustained mental health and well-being. Once people remit with the\\nbeneﬁt of early treatment it is crucial as with cancer to keep them well\\nor also intervene early should relapse occurs. Recovery-oriented\\napproaches recognize the importance of peer support networks and',\n"," 'community resources ( 280). Group-based psychosocial interventions\\nfor children and adolescents ex posed to traumatic events in\\nhumanitarian settings have been found to be effective in low- and\\nmiddle-income countries. For example, Alzaghoul et al. ( 281) found\\nthat a skills-based trauma-focused CBT program signi ﬁcantly\\nreduced PTSD and depression scores compared to waitlist groups.On the other hand, another study showed a small bene ﬁcial effect of\\npsychosocial support on PTSD symptoms at four weeks post-\\nintervention, but no difference in depressive and anxiety symptoms\\nbetween treatment and control groups ( 282). Community resources,\\nincluding support groups and local mental health services, play a vital\\nrole in continuing care. These resources help individuals maintain\\ntheir mental health gains post-treatment and provide ongoing\\nsupport to prevent relapse ( 283).\\nWhile there has been a real, yet modest and piecemeal,\\nexpansion of treatment availability and uptake for some young',\n"," 'people, thanks to model innovation, the prevalence and impact of\\nmental health conditions have not decreased in almost 25 years and\\nare rising among young people ( 14). There is a need for a radical\\nchange and decisive action which will involve a major boost to\\nprevention, early intervention and innovative youth focused\\ntreatment systems ( 14,263,284).\\n4.4 Barriers, strategies and opportunities,\\nincluding economic and\\npolitical considerations\\nPrevention, early diagnosis and intervention, and sustained\\naccess to evidence-based care have catalysed progress for other\\nnon-communicable diseases, leading to signi ﬁcant reductions in the\\nprevalence and impact of conditions such as cardiovascular disease\\nand some forms of cancer ( 285–287). These fundamental\\ncomponents of health care have not received the same recognition,\\nurgency for deployment, and investment in mental health ( 288–290).\\nThis explains the lack of reduction in the prevalence and burden of',\n"," 'mental disorders over the past 25 years ( 291). Worse still there has\\nbeen a parallel rise in rates of youth mental ill-health, increased help-\\nseeking and greater need for accessible and safe mental health services\\namong young people ( 30,201). However mental health services for\\nyoung people continue to be all too poorly designed, sparse in\\ncoverage and depth, and under-resourced, even in countries that\\nhave led youth mental health reform ( 13). Contributing to these\\nshortcomings are a range of personal and structural barriers. Young\\npeople may face personal barriers such as a lack of awareness about\\navailable services, mistrust of those services, stigma, misconceptions\\nsurrounding mental health, and fears around seeking help ( 292).\\nStructural barriers include the absence of supportive initiatives within\\nyoung people ’s circles of support (such as family, community, and\\neducational settings), limited-s ervice capacity, and inadequate',\n"," 'funding ( 292). Economic and political factors also present\\nsigniﬁcant barriers to improving the mental health landscape for\\nyoung people. Unaccountable government policies, harmful and\\nhidden economic orthodoxy, and the impact of unrestrained and\\nunregulated commercial and business activity can be extremely\\nharmful and result in large cohorts of the population being\\nexposed to iatrogenic effects and commercial drivers of mental ill\\nhealth ( 293,294). This is partially recognized but often overlooked in\\npolitical and economic decision-making. There is a need for mental\\nhealth impact analyses or statements ( 295), similar to environmental\\nimpact assessments, to be conducted before policies and projects are\\napproved.

This includes increased preventive efforts targeting risk\\nfactors and determinants of mental illness (e.g., social, economic\\nand environmental), as well as improved provision of evidence-\\nbased early intervention that has the capacity to meet the volume of\\ndemand ( 14). Additionally, as discussed in the previous sections, a\\nrange of methodological approaches should be utilized to\\nunderstand the megatrends related to young people ’s mental health.',\n"," 'Political will is essential for enacting policies that deliver mental\\nhealth equity, such as increased funding for mental health research\\nproportional to its share of the burden of disease and its impact on\\nsociety, implementation of school-based mental health programs, and\\nthe establishment of accessible mental health services ( 294,299).\\nPolitical will is directly proportional in a democracy to the level of\\npublic activism and demand for reform, which needs to be energised\\nand mobilised ( 300).

An immediate call to action was recently\\ndeclared, with a whole of society approach invited to address growing\\nrates of youth mental ill-health ( 18). To support this global\\nendeavour, core principles to guide youth mental health care in\\nlow-, middle- and high-income countries are available ( 304) and a\\nglobal blueprint to transform prevention and early intervention in\\nyouth mental health has been developed ( 305,306). An urgent and\\nserious public health response to the rising mental health needs of',\n"," 'young people is required. This has the capacity to yield massive\\npersonal, social, and economic returns. If implemented effectively,\\nmajor gains seen in other areas of health such as cancer and\\ncardiovascular disease are also possible for youth mental health,\\nand the mental health ﬁeld and community globally.\\n5 Limitations\\nIt is possible that factors not examined here, such as poor access\\nto and quality of mental health care, have led to an increasedprevalence, rather than incidence, of mental health issues among\\nyouth, as untreated or inadequately treated conditions may worsen\\nand persist over time.

While these conditions have\\nseen a signi ﬁcant rise in diagnoses over the past century and an\\nincrease in diagnosis-seeking b ehaviour post-pandemic, their\\nprevalence and trends remain uncertain due to the lack of robust\\ncommunity surveys. This gap in data also applies to evidence\\nregarding the time trends of several youth mental health\\ndisorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and eating\\ndisorders, which tend to be absent from many of the surveys of\\nmental health.
